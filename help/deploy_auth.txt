How to Authenticate a Shiny App to Google Sheets

1. Set Up Google Sheets API Access

Create a Project in Google Cloud Console

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Create a new project or select an existing one.
Enable Google Sheets API

Navigate to APIs & Services > Library.
Search for Google Sheets API and enable it for your project.
Create a Service Account

Go to APIs & Services > Credentials.
Click Create credentials and select Service account.
Fill in the necessary details and create the service account.
Download the JSON key file for the service account.
Share Google Sheet with Service Account

Open the Google Sheet you want to access.
Click the Share button.
Share the document with the email address of your service account (e.g., your-service-account@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com).
2. Set Up Authentication in R

Install and Load Required Packages

r
Copy code
install.packages("googlesheets4")
library(googlesheets4)
Authenticate with the Service Account Key

Use the gs4_auth function to authenticate using the path to your service account key JSON file.
r
Copy code
gs4_auth(path = "/path/to/your-service-account-key.json")
3. Access and Read Google Sheet

Specify the Google Sheet URL

Use the read_sheet function to access the Google Sheet by its URL.
r
Copy code
sheet_url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SHEET_ID/edit?resourcekey=&gid=YOUR_GID"
Read the Sheet Data

r
Copy code
sheet_data <- read_sheet(sheet_url)
4. Troubleshooting Permission Issues

Check Service Account Permissions

Ensure the service account has been granted access to the Google Sheet.
Verify OAuth Scopes

Make sure the necessary scopes are enabled in the Google Cloud Console:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly for read-only access.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets for read and write access.
Enable Google Sheets API

Confirm the API is enabled for your project in the Google Cloud Console.
5. Deploy the Shiny App

Deploy to shinyapps.io

Ensure that the service account key JSON file is included in your deployment package or securely managed using GitHub secrets.
Test Authentication

Verify that the Shiny app can access and read data from Google Sheets as expected.
